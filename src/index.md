Hello, I'm Est√©ban "[Barbapapazes](https://gh.soubiran.dev)" Soubiran.

I'm passionate about **web technologies**, continuously expanding my knowledge
in areas like technology, finance, and entrepreneurship. I love sharing
insights and collaborating with others. That's why I give talks and write
articles. I also stream on Twitch, where I work on projects, try out new
tools, and explain various concepts.

I favor simplicity over complexity when creating user experiences. I focus
on details to deliver the best possible product that pleases both the
client and the user.

Thus, I've developed expertise in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Angular**, **Vue** ,
**Nuxt**, **Adonis**, **Laravel**, which aids me in thoroughly understanding the
client's needs and proposing the best solutions.
